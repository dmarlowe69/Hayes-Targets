I worked for Hayes Targets from 1982 until they closed their doors
in November 1999
One on my creations was the TLX-1 Low Altitude Tow Target
The autopilot was built around an RCA 1802 COSMAC System. The
development systems was cassette tape based.
Once the project went into production I transfered development
to an American Automation CrossAssembler Systems and I captured the
source code and transferred it to the PC based tool.
