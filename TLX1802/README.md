I worked for Hayes Targets from 1982 until they closed their doors
in November 1999
One on my creations was the TLX-1 Low Altitude Tow Target
The autopilot was built around an RCA 1802 COSMAC System. The
development systems was cassette tape based.
Once the project went into production I transfered development
to an American Automation CrossAssembler Systems and I captured the
source code and transferred it to the PC based tool.

These files are the two fielded versions of the software and the American
Automation distribution tool set. 

I am recovering this historical development project as will add to it as I
can or am requested, if there is any interest.

I am semi-retired and don't wish all the hard work I put into this project to
vanish into "vapor-ware".

Using the Orginal COSMAC system inspired me to buy a Commodore 64 and I learned
much about assembler using that system.
