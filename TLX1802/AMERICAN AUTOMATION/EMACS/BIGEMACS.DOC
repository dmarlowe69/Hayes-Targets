BigEmacs is our friend uemacs.exe that has been tweaked to run a little 
faster on True-PC-Compatibles and provides a few extra features.

1.  Large Data Model - You can edit very large files with no problem, provided
you have the memory in your machine.

2.  Bios screen handler.  Makes a big difference in screen updates.

3.  The keypad works.  Insert is bound to 'open line', and delete is bound
    to 'delete forward.'  Other keys work as you might expect.

4.  'ALT' commands.  ALT <character> is the same as <CTL-X><CTL-<chararcter>>.

NOTES

If you try and suck a large amount of data into the kill buffer, things slow
down a lot.  There is an awful lot of processing going on there, and its all
done indirect through pointers.  If you really need to do this kind of thing,
don't reboot - go get a cup of coffee.

The default screen attribute is yellow on blue.  In order to change it,
run the program atpatch thusly:

	C>atpatch emacs.exe

atpatch displays all possible attributes in a rather disgusting manner, and
prompts you to choose one.  Once you've chosen one, it goes searching for the
magic attribute byte to change.  This takes a minute or two, but I didn't
figure it was worth optimizing for speed.
