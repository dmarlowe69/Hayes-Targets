Documentation for GETSYM

GETSYM is a program intended to aid in patching a file.  It extracts the
absolute label values from the xxxxxx.H file, and creates a yyyyyy.S file
containing a standard equate list.  The format for calling GETSYM is:

	GETSYM infile outfile

For example, If the following file was compiled and linked to generate a .H
file,

	Section CODE,$100

BEGIN	ADD.L	TEMP,ACCUM
		MOVEM	MASK,SAVEBLOCK

LOOP1	NOP
		NOP
		NOP
		JMP		LOOP1
ENDLOOP JMP		Terminate
		END

Then the command:

	 GETSYM xxxxx.H yyyy.S

might yield the following yyyy.S file (assuming TEMP, Terminate, ACCUM, MASK,
and SAVEBLOCK are defined) :

BEGIN	    EQU    $100
LOOP1	    EQU    $10C
ENDLOOP     EQU    $116
TEMP	    EQU    $11C
SAVEBLOCK   EQU    $120
MASK	    EQU    $3
ACCUM	    EQU    $AAC2

Which can be INCLUDEd into your patch source file to get the values of
important locations, like so:

	INCLUDE yyyy.S
	SECTION PATCH,BEGIN

	ADD.Q	TEMP,ACCUM		; Patch to fix an incorrect ADD.L

	END

We hope this provides some illumination into the use of GETSYM and patching.
