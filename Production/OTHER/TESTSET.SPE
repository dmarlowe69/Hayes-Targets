	SPECIFICATION TLX POWER SUPPLY/TEST SET, P/N 001-1265

	1. APPLICATION

		The Power Supply/Test Set is designed to allow the user to
	power up the TLX electronics and gain access to the critical test
	points in the autopilot computer. External power is required for
	ground testing as the TLX is powered by an alternator/Ram Air Turbine
	in flight. Measuring the outputs of the test points with a Digitial
	volt meter, allows for the TLX to be functionally tested, on the
	flight line, prior to loading on the tow aircraft.


	2. POWER SUPLLY/TEST SET DESCRITPION

		The Power Supply/Test set is composed of two functionally
	seperate devices, the power supply, and the TLX function test set.
	The unit contains a battery pack power supply and recharger, as well
	as the functional test set. The two sections are detailed below. The
	basic dimensions of the power supply/test set are:

	dimensions:	14" x 10" x 8"
	weigth: 	20 lbs (approximate)
	





	2.1 Power Supply - Detailed

		The power supply section of the test set consists of a two
	12 volt sealed lead-acid battery packs, connected in series, and two
	12 volts battery chargers, also in series. A six foot power cable
	connects the test set to the power input connector on the TLX computer. 

		The 24 volt output is controlled by an ON/OFF switch on the
	test set. The voltage level of the batteries is monitored by an analog
	meter at all times. The AC power to the chargers is fused and when
	applied, is indicated by a lamp. The AC cord is detachable and is
	stored in the hinged cover of the test set. The TLX power cable is also
	stowed in the hinged cover.


	Power Supply specifications:

	Power section

	output:				24 volts
	capacity:			6.0 ampere hour
	self dischrage rate:		3-5% at 77 Deg F
	

	Charger section

	output voltage:			12 volts (regulated)
	output current:			450 milliamperes
	charging characteristics:	cycled service voltage level
	Maximum allowable charge time:	72 hours
					(exceeding will de-grade battery life)
	input:				120 VAC +/- 10%  50-60 Hz


		The recharge time for the power supply is appoximately 14 to
	16 hours, allowing up to four hours of continuious opertation. The
	unit may be left on charge for longer periods on time, but should not
	exceed 72 hours. The TLX target may be tested while the unit is on
	charge, for a short period of time. 





	2.2  Test Set - Detailed	
		
		The Test Set part of the Power Supply/Test Set allows for basic
	functional flight line testing of the TLX. The test set is equiped with
	a six foot test cable which connects to the "TEST" connector on the
	TLX computer. The cable is stowed in the hinged cover of the test set
	when not in use.

		The test points monitored by the test set are:
	
	Radar Altimeter height signal (ALT SIG)
	Radar Altimeter lock signal (RELBL)
	Radar Altimeter Self Test switch (SELF TEST)

	Accelerometer signal (ACCLRM)

	Wing postion feedback potentiometer signal (FDBK SIG)
	Scaled wing position signal (for telemetry) (WING POSN)
	Computer commanded wing position signal (CMD)
	Feedback commanded wing postion signal (FDBK CMD)

	28 VDC power (28V)
	12 VDC power (12V)
	12 VDC power to feedback potentiometer (POT 12V)
	5  VDC power (5V)

	Modulation signal from Command receiver (REC SIG)
	Modulation signal to Telemetery transmitter (MOD)

	Fire 1 command lamp (F1)
	Fire 2 command lamp (F2)
	Fire 3 command lamp (F3)
	Fire 4 command lamp (F4)

		Most of the above test points are tip jacks for use with a
	standard digital volt meter. The modulation test points are BNC
	connectors for use with sheilded coxial cable and an oscilloscpe. The
	altimeter self test switch allows the radar altimeter to be check
	using its internal self test mode. The Fire command lamps allow the
	four firing command sent from the control station to be verified.
	
		When used in conjuction with the TLX control station, the test
	set allows the TLX target to be completely functional tested before
	loading on the tow aircraft.
