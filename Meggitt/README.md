Meggitt Defense Systems bought Southwest Aerospace in Tustin CA and then
bought Hayes Targets. Southwest Aerospace was a major competitor of Hayes.
The Plan presented by Meggitt was to keep both companies intact, but to
have each concentrate on there market Strenghts. Or at least that was
the Managing Director Terry Timms told everyone. That was not the case.
Hayes Targets was shut down, everyone laid off and the productline,
including my TLX-1 (and its variants) was moved to California. Before I had
enough of corporate overlords and left to start a new, I worked with their
engineers to update the autopilot due to obsolence issues. These files are
all that I have found from that time (1999). This was a work in progress and
very preliminary and just offered for hostorical purposes.
