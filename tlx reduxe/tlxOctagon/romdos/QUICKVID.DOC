			Printing using Quick Basic programs

Quick Basic normally tests if a display adapter card (ie CGA, EGA) 
is present when an .EXE is started up. For systems using COM1 as the main
console, the Quick Basic PRINT statement will not work.  A program in the 
\DISPLAY subdirectory, called AN-0050, shows how to print out and recieve
characters from COM1.  The PRINTS function allows you to print a string
out of the COM1 serial port.
