[Priority Channel Selection/Unhide Channel Data]

Select a channel for Priority Monitoring. The channel may be
either displayed or hidden (it will become unhidden). Only
one channel can be selected, so the previous Priority selec-
tion will be cancelled when the new one is selected. Two
angle brackets (">>") indicate the current selection.

Up/Down Arrows: Choose a channel.
Space Bar:	Activate the chosen channel for Priority.

NOTE! If Priority Monitoring (in Common Data) is disabled,
"ии" is displayed, and a Priority Channel cannot be selected.
Other channel data can still be edited after pressing the
Arrow Keys, but Common Data must be edited first to enable
the Priority feature.

:chedit_chno
[Edit Channel Number for Display on the Transceiver]

The Space Bar or keys 0 - 9 can be pressed to enter either
a blank and a number, two numbers (up to 99), or two blanks.
If two blanks are entered, the Transceiver will assign and
display a serial channel number (01-15) for this channel
automatically.

Arrow Keys: Change field (no change in Channel Number).
Space Bar:  Input a blank.
0 - 9:	    Input a digit.
Backspace:  Erase last input key.
Enter Key:  Accept displayed input.
Esc Key:    Cancel displayed input.

#
:chedit_rxf
[Edit Receive Frequency/Hide or Unhide Channel Data]

Use keys 0 - 9 to enter the desired receiving frequency, and
press the Enter key to accept. If the frequency does not
match the Channel Step parameter (in Common Data), it will be
adjusted to the nearest valid step. You do not need to enter
all 7 digits: empty digits to the right are zero-filled.

Pressing [.] (period) after several digits forces them to MHz.

Pressing only the Space Bar without entering a number toggles
the data for the entire channel between hidden and unhidden
(except the first channel, which cannot be hidden). Hidden
channels display "--" in place of field entries, and are not
used for operation (although they are still stored in hidden
form for possible recall later).
#
#
#
:page
#
Arrow Keys: Change field (before or after editing Frequency).
Space Bar:  Hide/Unhide entire channel (line).
0 - 9:	    Input a digit.

Backspace:  Erase digit to the left, or cancel entry.
Enter Key:  Accept displayed frequency, with zero-fill.
Esc Key:    Cancel and return to previous frequency.

:chedit_dec
[Toggle Tone Squelch Decoder, and set CTCSS frequency]

Press the Space Bar to toggle the decoder on/off, or press
Enter to display the Tone Select window, from which you may
select a frequency with the Arrow Keys (pressing Enter again
to accept, or Esc to cancel).

If you know the CTCSS frequency you want, you can enter it
directly with the 0 - 9 and [_] (underscore) keys. When the
desired CTCSS frequency is displayed, press Enter to accept.
If the frequency was invalid (not among the standard tones),
the Tone Select Window will appear as described above, with
the nearest valid frequency pre-selected.

Turning the CTCSS Decoder off also turns off BCLO if its
"tone" mode was enabled.
#

:chedit_bclo
[Busy Channel Lock-Out Carrier-Tone-Off Toggle]

The Space Bar (or Backspace Key) toggles the BCLO selection
between Carrier Control, Tone Control, or off. If the CTCSS
Decoder was off, selecting Tone controlled BCLO will turn it
on, and the tone frequency will be displayed in the CTCSS Dec
field to the left of this one.

Arrow Keys: Change field.
Space Bar, Backspace:  Toggle BCLO mode.
#
#
#
:chedit_scan
[Scan Stop/Skip Toggle]

If scanning is enabled in the Common Data, the Space Bar
selects whether this channel will be included in scanning, or
be skipped over.

If "ииии" is displayed in this field, scanning is disabled in
the Common Data, and no selection is possible unless Common
Data is first edited to enable scanning.
#
#
#
:chedit_save
[Power Saver on/off toggle]

Press the Space Bar to toggle the automatic Power Saver
feature on and off. When on, the transceiver draws less
current from the battery by turning itself off periodically
during squelched monitoring on this channel, to prolong
battery charge life. The Saving Interval (off time) can be
set in the Common Data.

Arrow Keys: Change fields after setting on/off.
Space Bar:  Toggle on/off.

NOTE! If "иии" appears in the Power Save field, Power Saving
      has been disabled (in Common Data). You must edit the
      Common Data to enable it before setting this field.
#
#
#
:chedit_txf
[Enter Transmit Frequency, and Enable/Disable Transmission]

Use keys 0 - 9 to enter the desired transmitting frequency,
and press the Enter key to accept. If the frequency does not
match the Channel Step parameter (in Common Data), it will be
adjusted to the nearest valid step. You do not need to enter
all 7 digits: empty digits to the right are zero-filled.

Pressing [.] (period) after several digits forces them to MHz.

Pressing only the Space Bar without entering a number toggles
the this channel's transmit capability on and off (when off,
previously set transmitting parameters are hidden until the
transmitter is again enabled for this channel).

Press the Space Bar to toggle the Encoder on/off, or press
Enter to display the Tone Select window, from which you may
select a frequency with the Arrow Keys (pressing Enter again
to accept, or Esc to cancel).

If you know the CTCSS frequency you want, you can enter it
directly with the 0 - 9 and [_] (underscore) keys (entering
a number or [_] forces the Encoder on). When the display
shows the desired CTCSS frequency, press Enter to accept.
If the frequency was invalid (not among the standard tones)
the Tone Select Window will appear as mentioned above.

NOTE! if the channel is hidden when you make an entry, it
will be unhidden. Edit the Rx Freq field to hide it again.

Pwr-On Priority:  
When enabled, Priority monitoring is active when radio is 
switched on.

"5s timer" selection causes scanning to	resume after a 
5-second pause. "Carrier" selection causes scanning to 
resume after squelch closes.
#

Time-Out before transmitter can be reactivated.

Tx Carrier Delay:
When the CTCSS option is installed and active and this 
feature is enabled, releasing the PTT switch will leave
the transmitter active (without modulation) for an extra
400ms, eliminating the squelch tail at the receiving end.

Power Save:
Sets the "sleep/awake" ratio for the power save function.
The "awake" time is either 30 or 300 ms (selected in hard-

suitable for the new value. For example, the Power Save Time
must NOT be set to less than the PLL lockup time (or the
receiver will NEVER be enabled!).

Editing these parameters requires that this program be
started with the -p switch on the command line. Otherwise
the settings can only be viewed.
