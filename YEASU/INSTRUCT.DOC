YAESU EEPROM PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE
VERSION 2.2


The programs on the YAESU  programming diskette require an IBM PC/AT
or PS/2 compatible computer with at least 128k RAM running IBM or MS DOS 2.0
or above, one 360k floppy drive, a monochrome or color monitor and one serial
port (COM1).  You also need a printer if you want to print hard copy of the
data.

IMPORTANT!  Do not work directly from this original YAESU programming diskette!
Make a copy of it and use the copy when programming the transceiver.  Keep the
original in a safe place in case you need to make another copy of it later.
The manuals that came with your computer should explain how to make a copy of
a diskette, using the DISKCOPY command from DOS.

The YAESU  programming diskette (VER 2.20) contains the following files for
FTH-2008/7008/FTH-2009/7009 and FTH-2070 radios:


     INSTRUCT.DOC - A text file containing a copy of these instructions

     2070.EXE -     The EEPROM programming program

     CE2.EXE -      Programming editor for FTH-2008 and FTH-7008

     CE2.HLP -      Help files for CE2.EXE command program

     2008.CH -         parameter data for FTH-2008

     7008.CH -         parameter data for FTH-7008

     2009.CH -         parameter data for FTH-2009

     7009.CH -         parameter data for FTH-7009



You can use the software to create and edit data files without having to
connect the computer to the transceiver.  However, before connecting a
transceiver for programming or cloning, turn off your computer and the
transceiver, and connect the Programming Interface Box to the computer and the
transceiver as shown on page 2-12 of the FTH-2070 Service Manual.  Then
restart the computer.  Turning off the equipment during interconnect avoids
damage to the electronics.





FTH-2070

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR VERSION 1.40 SOFTWARE FOR ALL FTH-2070'S

              TO-DATE THERE HAVE BEEN TWO VERSIONS OF THE FTH-2070
              RADIOS AND TWO VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE.
              THIS LATEST SOFTWARE, VERSION 1.40 WILL PROGRAM BOTH
              VERSIONS OF THE FTH-2070 RADIOS SO IF YOU HAVE THE OLD
              VERSION OF SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD USE IT TO MAKE A COPY OF
              THIS VERSION AND USE ONLY THIS NEW VERSION TO PROGRAM
              RADIOS.

                         ********** CAUTION **********

              THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF RADIO YOU
              HAVE IS TO DOWNLOAD THE "COMMON DATA" FROM THE RADIO
              BEFORE YOU TRY TO PROGRAM IT. IF YOU TRY TO PROGRAM
              THE RADIO WITH THE WRONG COMMON DATA BEFORE DOWNLOADING
              THE COMMON DATA FROM THE RADIO, YOU WILL PROBABLY
              DESTROY THE COMMON DATA IN THE RADIO AND YOU WILL GET AN
              "ERR 2" MESSAGE ON THE RADIO LCD.  THE "ERR 2" MESSAGE
              WILL REMAIN ON THE LCD UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE RADIO
              ACCEPTS PROGRAMMING.

              IN THE EARLY VERSION FTH-2070 RADIOS THE COMMON DATA
              FREQUENCY BANDS WERE:

                     VHF: 150 - 170 MHz   UHF: 450 - 470 MHz

              THE CURRENT VERSION FTH-2070 RADIOS WILL SHOW THE
              FOLLOWING FREQUENCIES IN THE COMMON DATA:

                     VHF: 134 - 174 MHz   UHF: 400 - 500 MHz

              YOU MUST HAVE THE CORRECT FREQUENCY BAND INCLUDED
              IN THE COMMON DATA FOR THE RADIO TO ACCEPT THE PROGRAM!

                         PLEASE NOTE *****************

              IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CORRECT COMMON DATA IN THE RADIO
              AND DOWNLOAD YOUR PROGRAM, THE CHANNEL DATA WILL BE LOST
              WHEN YOU CORRECT THE COMMON DATA!!! IT CANNOT BE SAVED
              AND WILL BE LOST WHEN YOU CHANGE ANY OF THE COMMON DATA.



                        ********* C A U T I O N *********

              IT IS BEST TO DOWNLOAD THE COMMON DATA FROM THE RADIO TO
              DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF RADIO YOU HAVE, IF THERE IS ANY
              DOUBT ON THIS MATTER BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE PROGRAMMING OF
              THE RADIO!

When ready to run the program (after booting DOS), place your COPY of the
YAESU diskette (NOT the original!) in drive A or B, and log onto that drive
(type A: or B: and press [ENTER]).  Then type YAESU and press [ENTER].  You
should be greeted by the Main Menu screen, as shown below.  Contact YAESU
U.S.A.  for assistance if required.  See end of INSTRUCT.DOC file for phone
numbers and FAX number.


                          (Main Menu Screen)

The YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR screen:

This screen offers you a choice of the main features of the program by pressing
a number from 1 to 8, and is self-explanatory.  However, a few general comments
may be helpful; you will always return to this screen after completing one of
the actions listed, and can then select another feature, or Quit [8].  When
finished with the program, always use the Quit [8] selection of the YAESU
FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR - don't turn off the power switch or disconnect the
cables to the transceiver until after the program has been exited.  When you
select the Quit [8] option, you will be asked to confirm quitting [Y] before
the program exits back to the DOS prompt.

                        ********* NOTE *********

To Put the FTH-2070 into the programming/clone mode you need to hold
down the PRI button while turning the radio on.


WHICH SELECTION TO CHOOSE FIRST:

If you have a customer's transceiver connected to the computer, you may want
to upload the data and save it to disk before doing anything else.  Choose
Read Data from Transceiver [4], and follow the prompts.  If an error message
is displayed when attempting to upload the data, check your cables, Programming
Interface Box and power supply carefully.  After uploading the data from the
transceiver, save it to disk [6] right away as described below (under "Save
Channel Data to Disk").

If no FTH-2070 is connected to the computer and you just want to view or edit
data files already on the disk, choose YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR, Load
Channel Data from Disk [5].  You will be asked for the name of the file to
load, which MUST be the name of a channel data file already on the disk.  The
only such file provided on the original diskette is TEST2070, but you will be
adding your own files.  To see a list of all files, type a period [.] and
[ENTER] when ask for the file name.  This will display all current files, you
may then select and type the name of the file you want to load.  If an error
message appears during loading, either no file could be found on the disk with
that name, or the file data was corrupted since it was last saved.  If the data
was corrupted you will have to build a new file from scratch, or enter another
file name.  We suggest you erase any corrupted files from the disk to avoid
confusion.  Just enter DEL filename.ext at the DOS prompt.

If you have an unprogrammed transceiver connected, or if you have no existing
data file to load for editing, you can create new data to be saved on the disk
before downloading to a transceiver.  Just proceed to the next paragraph.


CREATING AND EDITING CHANNEL DATA:

If you want to work with existing data from the transceiver or a data file,
you should have loaded it as described.  Now select [1] from the YAESU FTH-2070
EEPROM DATA EDITOR to edit or to create a new set of channel data.  A screen
like the following will appear (this one appears after loading TEST2070, the
supplied data file):

The items at the upper left; Band limits, VHF and UHF REF: and Tone Option are
Common Data items that you may need to refer to when making entries in the
channel table, for example, if the VHF Ref is 5.00 KHz, all frequencies entered
must be multiples of 5 KHz.  If no tone option is installed, the "Opt DEC" and
"Opt ENC" fields in the table are not used.  You cannot change Common Data
settings from this screen.

The KEY HELP box at the upper right shows the functions that are available to
you at any given moment.  The contents of this box change according to the
location of the cursor in the table, so you will need to watch this box while
becoming familiar with the channel editor.  The last line in the box, "Entry
Fmt", shows the type of data that is expected to be entered in the field where
the cursor is presently located.  For example, when the editing screen is first
selected, the cursor is in the "Ch" (Channel Number) field, which can accept
two digits between 00 and 63.  Notice that the space bar can be used to
erase an entire line (one channel's data) in the table.  The data can be
restored by just pressing the space bar again.  To program receive only, as
shown in Ch 14 above, move cursor to the TX Freq position, after receive data
has been entered, and press space bar, TX OFF will be shown on the Tx Freq
line.  This function can be toggled with the space bar.

Press the up, down, left and right arrow keys on the PC's keypad to move the
cursor around the table (if you have a numeric keypad you may have to press the
Num Lock key to switch the keypad from numeric to cursor movement mode).

Each of the sixteen lines in the editing table represents one channel, with
the columns indicating the current setting of each parameter that can be set
for that channel.  Hyphens indicate that a channel or parameter is not
currently being used.

NOTE:  When a transceiver is to be programmed with more than sixteen channels,
after setting up the display for the first sixteen, press the PgDn or PgUp key
to edit the next sixteen channels, and again to return to the previously-
displayed channels.  The table will be cleared, but don't worry, the first
sixteen channels are held in memory.  When you have entered all of the channel
data desired, confirm that it is correct and then press the [Esc] key to return
to the Main Menu.


SAVING DATA TO DISK:

You can save data to a disk file at any time by selecting [6] from the YAESU
FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR.  You MUST do this if you have just edited the
channel tables data and want to be able to use the data, as changed, again
later, but we also suggest you do this as soon as you have uploaded data from a
transceiver (so you will be able to restore it if a problem develops later).
You will be asked for file name to save to.  This can be any valid DOS file
name, but we recommend you choose a name that you will be able to recognize
later.  Be careful not to select a name that already exists.


SENDING DATA TO THE TRANSCEIVER:

After editing data and saving it to a file on disk, you can download it to a
transceiver.  If the cables are not connected, you should select Quit [8] from
the YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR (after making sure you have saved any
edited data to a file), and then turn off the computer to connect the
Programming Interface Box, Transceiver and cables.  Then restart the program,
reload the saved file from disk (YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR selection
[5]), and then send the data to the Transceiver (YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA
EDITOR selection [3]).  After a few seconds for data translation (to the
"clone" format required by the EEPROM), you should see a message reminding you
to set the transceiver to the CLONE mode.  Then press any key (except Esc) to
start the download.  If an error message is displayed when attempting to
download the data, check your cables, Programming Interface Box and power
supply carefully.  Any key will return you to the YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA
EDITOR, where you can try again.  To program another transceiver with the same
data, you can change the cable connection without having to turn off the
computer and restart the program.  CAUTION: Make sure the CLONE switch is OFF
when changing the connector.


EDITING COMMON DATA:

Common data here means those parameters which affect all channels in the
transceiver.  Some of these can be easily changed: TX (transmitter) Time-
Out, Timeout resume (the minimum delay after time-out before transmission can
resume), Battery power saver (pulsed receiver monitoring), TX lock-out
(transmitter inhibit by presence of a carrier).  The FTH-2070 frequency
coverage and IF can be changed ONLY by changes within the radio.  PLL steps can
be changed by highlighting the VHF or UHF Ref: and toggling, using the space
bar.

The changeable common data parameters can be edited by selecting [2] from the
YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM DATA EDITOR.  The following screen will appear, with one
of the parameters highlighted.


          View/Change Common Data
                                                [ESC] = Return to Menu
                                                [SPACE] = Increment (or
                                                ON/OFF)

     VHF Prescaler: 1/64      UHF Prescaler: 1/64

      * MUST USE THESE FREQUENCIES WHEN ON CURRENT MODEL FTH-2070 RADIOS

Use the SPACE bar to toggle switchable parameters on and off, or with the
Backspace key to step through numeric selections (numbers are not entered
directly).  When finished, press [Esc] to return to the YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM
DATA EDITOR.  Remember to save any changes to disk.


LISTING DATA TO SCREEN OR PRINTER:

If you want to have a printed copy of a set of data, or if you just want to
view data without making any changes, select [7] from the YAESU FTH-2070 EEPROM
DATA EDITOR.  After a few seconds for conversion of the data to "cloning"
format, a screen appears describing your options (print to screen or disk, 5
screen pages).  Just press any key (except [Esc]) to move from one page to the
next.  The last two pages are a hex dump of the data as it would appear in the
EEPROM, with a checksum at the end of the last page.  To print a displayed page
on the printer, if you have a PC keyboard with the PrtSc key also serving as an
asterisk key, press and hold the Shift key while pressing PrtSc.  Otherwise, if
you have an enhanced AT keyboard, just press the Print Screen key (near the
upper right).


*******************************************************************************





FTH-2008/2009/7008/7009

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR YAESU CE2 PROGRAM EDITOR
VERSION  1.20

Programming of these radios is a relatively simple task but
you must follow the proper sequence to properly program the
radio.  It is assumed that you have booted your computer from
your own DOS disk or hard disk.  This disc is not a bootable
system disk.  After you have booted DOS, place this disc in the A:
or B: drive and type in A: or B: and press [ENTER].  You should
be at the A:\> or B:\> prompt.

The CE2 program automatically configures your COM1 serial port for
the proper baud rate, parity, etc. and is not set up to program
the radio through any other port other than COM1.

To start the program you should type YAESU at the A:\> or B:\> prompt
and press [ENTER].  The Main Menu Screen will be displayed.  You can
now select FTH-2008/7008 or FTH-2009/7009 as required.

Printing of this file from the Main Menu Screen assumes you are using a
parallel printer, as the COM1 serial port is being used for connection
of the Program Interface Box.

After several informational screens, note the Function Key listing at the
bottom of your screen.  You should also note that [F1] is listed as the help
key and will provide on screen help at any point in the programming
procedure.  Don't be afraid to use it whenever you have a question at a
particular point in the programming process.

When saving your channel data to disk it is recommended to use a DOS file
extension of .ch as these will be automatically added to the menu selection
when (F3) diskload is used.



            HARDWARE -- FRB-2 PROGRAMMER INTERFACE

The FRB-2 will need to be connected to your COM1 serial port
on your computer and the interconnecting cable connected to
the microphone input jack on the radio.  Proper power must
also be connected to the FRB-2.  There is an on/off switch on
the back of the unit and when it is turned on the Red LED
indicator will light.  Keep the radio turned off until you
have all other connections completed and ready to go.  The
FRB-2 can be used in programming the FTH-2070 by use of a
special cable for connecting the FRB-2 to the FTH-2070.
Instructions and a kit, part # TRB-20701, with parts to
construct this cable is available through the YAESU U.S.A.
parts department, (213)-404-4847.

You will need to remove the rubber cover from over the PTT
switch/monitor switch for programming the FTH-2008/7008.  This
will expose a small slide switch.  To program the radio this
slide switch must be in the DOWN (toward the bottom of the
radio) position and kept in this position until all programming
is completed.  Follow the prompts in the editor as far as
transferring data either to or from the radio ROM.

When programming is completed turn the radio off and be sure to
move the slide switch to the UP position, replace the rubber
cover, and the radio should be ready for use.

----------------------------------------------------------


PRIORITY CHANNEL SELECTION/UNHIDE CHANNEL DATA:

Select a channel for Priority Monitoring.  The channel may be
either displayed or hidden (it will become unhidden).  Only
one channel can be selected, so the previous Priority
selection will be cancelled when the new one is selected.  Two
angle brackets (">>") indicate the current selection.

Up/Down Arrows: Choose a channel.
Space Bar:      Activate the chosen channel for Priority.

NOTE! If Priority Monitoring (in Common Data) is disabled,
"__" is displayed, and a Priority Channel cannot be selected.
Other channel data can still be edited after pressing the
Arrow Keys, but Common Data must be edited first to enable
the Priority feature.


EDIT CHANNEL NUMBER FOR DISPLAY ON THE TRANSCEIVER:

The Space Bar or keys 0 - 9 can be pressed to enter either
a blank and a number, two numbers (up to 99), or two blanks.
If two blanks are entered, the Transceiver will assign and
display a serial channel number (01-15) for this channel
automatically.

Arrow Keys: Change field (no change in Channel Number).
Space Bar:  Input a blank.
0 - 9:      Input a digit.
Backspace:  Erase last input key.
Enter Key:  Accept displayed input.
Esc Key:    Cancel displayed input.


EDIT RECEIVE FREQUENCY/HIDE OR UNHIDE CHANNEL DATA:

Use keys 0 - 9 to enter the desired receiving frequency, and
press the Enter key to accept.  If the frequency does not
match the Channel Step parameter (in Common Data), it will be
adjusted to the nearest valid step.  You do not need to enter
all 7 digits: empty digits to the right are zero-filled.

Pressing [.] (period) after several digits forces them to MHz.

Pressing only the Space Bar without entering a number toggles
the data for the entire channel between hidden and unhidden
(except the first channel, which cannot be hidden).  Hidden
channels display "--" in place of field entries, and are not
used for operation (although they are still stored in hidden
form for possible recall later).

Arrow Keys: Change field (before or after editing Frequency).
Space Bar:  Hide/Unhide entire channel (line).
0 - 9:      Input a digit.
[.]:        Set last three (or fewer) digits as MHz.
Backspace:  Erase digit to the left, or cancel entry.
Enter Key:  Accept displayed frequency, with zero-fill.
Esc Key:    Cancel and return to previous frequency.


TOGGLE TONE SQUELCH DECODER, AND SET CTCSS FREQUENCY:
